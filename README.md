# ✅ Task Tracker Project

The Task Tracker is a command-line application built with Python that helps users efficiently manage their daily tasks.  
It provides an interactive menu where users can add, update, delete, and view tasks. Each task is automatically assigned a unique ID when created, making it easy to identify and modify specific entries.  

All tasks are stored in a JSON file, ensuring that the data remains available even after the program is closed.

   🧠 Overview

This project provides a simple yet efficient way to manage tasks directly from the terminal.
It demonstrates the use of file handling, functions, conditional logic, loops, and JSON operations in Python.

By developing this project, I enhanced my understanding of data management, modular code design, and user interaction in Python applications.
